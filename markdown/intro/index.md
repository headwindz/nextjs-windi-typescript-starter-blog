# About me

I am currently a professor of computer sciences at the Cambridge AI Lab. My research is in the broad field of artificial intelligence. In particular, my work revolves around the areas of knowledge representation and reasoning, knowledge graphs, computational logic, semantic technologies, and their applications to data management and the Web. In the past, I focused around the ontology language OWL. More recently, I became interested in applying ontology techniques to data management problems in databases and big data. Specifically, I am investigating ways in using variants of datalog â€” a language at the intersection of logic programming and databases â€” to represent and access data, and I am studying the related theoretical and practical problems, such as efficient evaluation of datalog programs and efficient maintenance of datalog materialisations.
